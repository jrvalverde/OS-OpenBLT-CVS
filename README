The CVS tree here is not the original CVS from the openBLT project.

This is a reconstituted CVS tree I built out of the existing tarballs in
the parent directory.

Many of those tarballs seem to be incomplete. My original idea was to
untar all of them one on top of each other to try and get a (hopefully)
full source tree. While doing this I further thought that if there were
inconsistencies in the final tree I wouldn't be able to trace them back
and moreover, it would be nice to have a CVS repository holding all the
versions just in case.

Thus I deleted everything and started all over again, building a script
that would create an empty repository, loop over all tar.gz files, and
for each one, checkout the previous tree, untar the new archive, import
all files (including any new ones) and commit them to the repository.

That is what you can find here. Not other thing. It is a pity that the
original files have disappeared from the map, and this was my attempt
at a best reconstruction.

Yours,
